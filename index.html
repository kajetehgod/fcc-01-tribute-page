          Charles Messier was a French astronomer who created a Catalog of Nebulae and Star Clusters (Catalog des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles), one of the most famous lists of astronomical objects.
        </p>
        <p class="intro__text">
          Messier was searching for comets, so the initial purpose of the catalog was to distinguish between comets and nebulae. Now Messier catalog is the set of 110 deep-sky objects, many of which are still referenced by their Messier numbers. Some well-known examples of the objects are M1 (Crab Nebula), M31 (Andromeda Galaxy), and  M87 (Virgo A).
