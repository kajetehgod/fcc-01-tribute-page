      Charles Messier was a French astronomer who created a Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters (Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles), one of the most famous lists of astronomical objects.

    <h2 class="timeline-title">Important Facts</h2>
    <ul class="timeline">
      <li class="timeline__item">
        Charles Messier was born in 1730 in Badonviller, France.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        His interest in astronomy was influenced by the appearance of the great six-tailed comet in 1744 and the annular solar eclipse, which was visible from his hometown in 1748.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        In 1751 Messier started working for Joseph Nicolas Delisle, the astronomer of the French Navy, keeping records of his observations.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        In 1753 Messier first documented an observation of the Mercury transit, followed by his observations journals at Hôtel de Cluny (now the Musée national du Moyen Âge), and at the French Navy observatories.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        In 1764 Messier was made a fellow of the Royal Society.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        In 1769 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        In 1770 he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        Messier published the first version of his catalogue in 1774 in the journal of the French Academy of Sciences in Paris. At that time the catalogue contained 45 unnumbered objects.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        By 1780 the catalogue had increased to 70 objects.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        The final version of the Messier catalogue was published in 1781 in the Connaissance des Temps, an official yearly publication of astronomical ephemerides in France, and contained 103 objects.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        Messier discovered 13 comets and co-discovered one comet, a discovery shared with several other observers.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        Messier died in 1817 and was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. His grave is near the graves of Frédéric Chopin and Abraham-Louis Breguet.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        Messier objects M104 through M110 were added to the catalog between 1921 and 1967. In 1921 Nicolas Camille Flammarion added Messier 104. In 1947 Helen Sawyer Hogg added M105, M105, and M107. In 1960 Owen Gingerich added M108 and M109. In 1967 Kenneth Glyn Jones added M110.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        Messier was searching for comets, so the initial purpose of the catalogue was to distinguish between permanent and transient visually diffuse celestial objects (comets). Now Messier catalogue is the set of 110 astronomical deep-sky objects that can be observed from Earth's Northern Hemisphere. Many Messier objects are still referenced by their Messier numbers.
      </li>
      <li class="timeline__item">
        Modern amateur astronomers use Messier objects for visual study and astrophotography. They organize Messier marathons, events dedicated to findind as many Messier objects as possible during one night.
